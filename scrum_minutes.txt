SPRINT 2 SCRUM MEETINGS
--------------------------------------------------------

Scrum Meeting 1 for Lo-Tree-Tea
Prepared by: Lohitaksh (Lohit) Allampalli
Meeting Date: Monday, April 7th, 2025

Attendees: All (Paul Hedman, Jack Williams, David Armijo, Lohit Allampalli)

Agenda:
    - Check if Cashier Page is made and API calls can fetch all menu items
    - Check in with Paul about OAuth2

Update Since Last Meeting:
    - Paul has changed logging into via Cashier or Manager to be based on an email instead of pins. Uses OAuth2 so it is much more secure 
    - Jack has finished making the Cashier page -- he can fetch the needed items but an order cannot yet be made (backend API calls to POST)
    - Jack has added translate API to the kiosk page
    - Paul has fully styled the Inventory management page -- task complete

Before Next Meeting:
    - Jack to finish the Kiosk UI so that it is more stylized, accessible, and better fits the Translate API
    - Paul to finish OAuth2
    - David to begin API calls for POST to orders so that an order can be made from the frontend
    - Jack to begin using the Weather API to display basic weather info
